You can create a keyboard shortcut to open Firefox with Gmail.com as the default website by following these steps:

   1. Open System Preferences by clicking on the Apple menu in the top left corner of the screen and selecting "System Preferences."

   2. Click on "Keyboard" and then select the "Shortcuts" tab.

   3. Click on "App Shortcuts" in the left sidebar.

   4. Click the "+" button to add a new shortcut.

   5. In the "Application" field, select "Firefox."

   6. In the "Menu Title" field, type "Gmail.com" (without quotes) exactly as it appears in Firefox's menu, including capitalization and punctuation.

   7. Click on the "Keyboard Shortcut" field and press the keys you want to use as the shortcut. For example, you could use "Command + Shift + G" or "Option + G."

   8. Click "Add" to save the new shortcut.

   9. Close the System Preferences window.

Now, whenever you press the keys you specified, Firefox will open with Gmail.com as the default website.
